# MicroPython library for the Elecfreaks Pico:ed V2
The purpose of this library is to make using the Pico:ed V2 with MicroPython possible.

Others seem to have dropped MicroPython support for the Pico:ed V2 and its IS31FL3731 display in favor of CircuitPython.

## Provided examples
The files in the 'examples' folder show the different capabilities available and how to use those.

## Deployment
### MicroPython
The Pico:ed V2 is based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU, so the following MicroPython installation instructions can be used:

### This library
To use the library, copy the 'picoed_v2_lib' folder to the root folder of the Pico:ed.

E.g. in Thonny right click on the folder and select 'Upload to /'.

This way different libraries can each have their own folder.
