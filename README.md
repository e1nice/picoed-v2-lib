# MicroPython library for the Elecfreaks Pico:ed V2
The purpose of this library is to make using the Pico:ed V2 with MicroPython possible.

Others seem to have dropped MicroPython support for the Pico:ed V2 and its IS31FL3731 display in favor of CircuitPython.

## Provided examples
The files in the 'examples' folder show the different capabilities available and how to use those.
